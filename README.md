# Poke Battle Buddy data

Usage stats for the Poke Battle Buddy (iOS) Team Builder: the most-used Pokémon in each
competitive format, with their common moves, items, abilities, Tera types, EV spreads, teammates, and checks and counters.

- `meta.json` is what the app downloads (about once a day per device).
- `build_meta.py` builds it. A [GitHub Action](.github/workflows/update.yml) runs it every day, finds the newest month,
  generation and most-played VGC/Champions formats on its own, and commits only when something changed.
